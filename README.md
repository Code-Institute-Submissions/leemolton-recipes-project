# Database Recipe-Project

This is my database project for the Full Stack Development course and I decided to use the Recipe idea. I wanted to create a database of recipes, largely English meals ranging
from a Roast Lamb Dinner to Gammon and Eggs. There is a database of recipes that can be searched and viewed by any user. This project can be viewed at https://my-cooking-recipe.herokuapp.com.

## UX

### Strategy
    <li>This is a basic online recipe book, As a user, I would expect to enter a new recipe.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would expect to be able to see all the recipes.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would expect to be able to search on existing recipes.</li>

## Existing Features

### Header and Footer
    <li>The header displays the title of the website which is clickable and will take the user back to the home page.</li>
    <li>There is a menu bar on the top right with navigation to the various pages of the website.</li>

### Index
    <li>The home page starts with a search bar which users can enter food or a country to view recipes.</li>
    <li>Underneath this are 6 popular recipes with images and a link to let the user view the recipe.</li>

### Add a Recipe
    <li>The page starts with a form for the user to input into. The user starts by inputting their name and country where they are from.</li>
    <li>They then add the name of the cuisine, the item(s), quantity and if there are any allergens. The send button will then send this recipe to the database.</li>

    The pages have been tested and all the links to the pages to ensure that they work properly and take the user to the right place. 
    The navigation bar is at the top of every page. All of the navigation has been tested on smaller screen devices too.
    
    <li>Search Recipe bar</li>
    I tested the input of the search bar and displayed a few different recipes. I clicked on the View Recipe button to display the specific recipe.
